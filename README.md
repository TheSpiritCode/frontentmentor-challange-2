## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

That was basically first project I did with flexbox from the scratch, so that was new to me. I know now how to center a div! üòÅ

### Continued development

There is still a lot to learn in flexbox area for me. I hope I can learn more than just boxing and centering items later on.
